# Immutable Passport Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through integrating Immutable Passport into your application. Immutable Passport is a secure and efficient way to authenticate users and perform blockchain transactions. We'll create a simple application to demonstrate the integration.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of JavaScript.
- An Immutable Developer Hub account.

## 2. Creating a Simple Application
You can start by creating a basic application using your preferred framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue). Here's a simple example using React:

```bash
npx create-react-app passport-demo
cd passport-demo
npm start
```

## 3. Registering the Application on Immutable Developer Hub
Go to the Immutable Developer Hub and create a new application. This will provide you with the necessary client ID and client secret for Passport integration.

## 4. Installing and Initializing the Passport Client
In your React application, install the Immutable Passport client:

```bash
npm install immutable-passport-client
```

In your app, initialize the client with the client ID obtained from the Developer Hub:

```javascript
import { Passport } from 'immutable-passport-client';

const passport = new Passport({
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
});
```

## 5. Logging in a User with Passport
Create a login button in your application. When the user clicks it, use the `passport.login()` method to initiate the Passport authentication flow:

```javascript
passport.login().then((result) => {
  if (result) {
    // User is logged in, you can perform actions here.
  }
});
```

## 6. Displaying User Information
After successful login, you can access user information like the ID token, access token, and nickname:

```javascript
const idToken = passport.getIdToken();
const accessToken = passport.getAccessToken();
const nickname = passport.getNickname();

console.log('ID Token:', idToken);
console.log('Access Token:', accessToken);
console.log('Nickname:', nickname);
```

## 7. Logging Out a User
To log out a user, simply call the `passport.logout()` method:

```javascript
passport.logout();
```

## 8. Initiating a Transaction from Passport
To initiate a blockchain transaction, use the Passport client's `initiateTransaction()` method:

```javascript
passport.initiateTransaction({ data: 'Your transaction data' }).then((transactionHash) => {
  console.log('Transaction Hash:', transactionHash);
});
```

## 9. Conclusion
You've successfully integrated Immutable Passport into your application. You can explore additional features and customize your application further using the Immutable Passport documentation.
